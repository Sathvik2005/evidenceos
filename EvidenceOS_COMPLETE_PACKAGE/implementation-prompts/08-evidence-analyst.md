# Prompt 08 — Evidence Analyst Agent

## Objective

Implement the Evidence Analyst Agent.

Input: a claim plus all validated evidence for that claim.
Output: a structured assessment.

Requirements:
1. Assess support, partial support, contradiction, and insufficiency.
2. Consider contradictory evidence explicitly.
3. Distinguish correlation from causation.
4. Explain the reasoning using only supplied evidence.
5. Never invent evidence.
6. Produce a proposed state and confidence with rationale.
7. Preserve evidence IDs used in the assessment.
8. Add golden tests for supported, partial, conflicting, and insufficient cases.

## Read Before Starting

Read the authoritative EvidenceOS specifications before making changes:

- `CONTEXT.md`
- `PRD.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `DATA_MODEL.md`
- `AGENT_SPEC.md`
- `WORKFLOW.md`
- `EVALUATION.md`
- `UI_SPEC.md`
- `RULES.md`
- `BUILD_PLAN.md`
- `HARNESS.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`

Also inspect the current repository before changing anything.

## Global Constraints

- Do not assume the repository is empty.
- Preserve working behavior unless this prompt explicitly changes it.
- Do not fabricate data, sources, citations, API responses, or test results.
- Prefer existing dependencies and conventions.
- Keep changes scoped to this prompt.
- Do not silently change architecture or specifications.
- Keep secrets outside source control.
- Use strict typing.
- Add tests appropriate to the change.
- If a test fails, determine whether it is pre-existing or caused by your changes.
- Do not proceed to the next implementation prompt automatically.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implementation matches the relevant authoritative specifications.
- [ ] Changes are scoped to this prompt.
- [ ] Type safety is preserved.
- [ ] Relevant tests are added or updated.
- [ ] Existing relevant tests pass.
- [ ] No fabricated behavior or data was introduced.
- [ ] No secrets were committed.
- [ ] Documentation is updated where necessary.
- [ ] The completion report is produced.
- [ ] The agent stops after this prompt.
