# Prompt 09 — Deterministic Validation

## Objective

Implement the deterministic validation layer described in EVALUATION.md and RULES.md.

Hard rules must include:
- supported requires valid supporting evidence;
- evidence requires a valid claim and source;
- excerpt is required;
- relationships and states must be valid;
- evidence references must belong to the claim;
- contradictions cannot silently disappear;
- state changes require a real triggering evidence record;
- provenance is mandatory;
- fabricated sources are rejected;
- insufficient evidence is allowed and must remain conservative.

Return structured validation results. Add failure-injection and unit tests.

Deterministic rules must override weak or contradictory LLM reasoning.

## Read Before Starting

Read the authoritative EvidenceOS specifications before making changes:

- `CONTEXT.md`
- `PRD.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `DATA_MODEL.md`
- `AGENT_SPEC.md`
- `WORKFLOW.md`
- `EVALUATION.md`
- `UI_SPEC.md`
- `RULES.md`
- `BUILD_PLAN.md`
- `HARNESS.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`

Also inspect the current repository before changing anything.

## Global Constraints

- Do not assume the repository is empty.
- Preserve working behavior unless this prompt explicitly changes it.
- Do not fabricate data, sources, citations, API responses, or test results.
- Prefer existing dependencies and conventions.
- Keep changes scoped to this prompt.
- Do not silently change architecture or specifications.
- Keep secrets outside source control.
- Use strict typing.
- Add tests appropriate to the change.
- If a test fails, determine whether it is pre-existing or caused by your changes.
- Do not proceed to the next implementation prompt automatically.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implementation matches the relevant authoritative specifications.
- [ ] Changes are scoped to this prompt.
- [ ] Type safety is preserved.
- [ ] Relevant tests are added or updated.
- [ ] Existing relevant tests pass.
- [ ] No fabricated behavior or data was introduced.
- [ ] No secrets were committed.
- [ ] Documentation is updated where necessary.
- [ ] The completion report is produced.
- [ ] The agent stops after this prompt.
