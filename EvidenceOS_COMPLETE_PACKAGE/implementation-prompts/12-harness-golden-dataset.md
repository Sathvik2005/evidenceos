# Prompt 12 — Harness & Golden Dataset

## Objective

Implement the EvidenceOS evaluation harness.

Layers:
1. static checks
2. unit tests
3. contract tests
4. golden tests
5. E2E tests
6. harness report

Add the 20 GOLDEN_SPECS.md cases or equivalent executable fixtures.

Required commands:
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run test:contracts
npm run test:golden
npm run test:e2e
npm run harness

The harness must clearly distinguish hard-rule failures, semantic regressions, infrastructure failures, and model variance.

Do not declare a pass when a hard gate fails.

## Read Before Starting

Read the authoritative EvidenceOS specifications before making changes:

- `CONTEXT.md`
- `PRD.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `DATA_MODEL.md`
- `AGENT_SPEC.md`
- `WORKFLOW.md`
- `EVALUATION.md`
- `UI_SPEC.md`
- `RULES.md`
- `BUILD_PLAN.md`
- `HARNESS.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`

Also inspect the current repository before changing anything.

## Global Constraints

- Do not assume the repository is empty.
- Preserve working behavior unless this prompt explicitly changes it.
- Do not fabricate data, sources, citations, API responses, or test results.
- Prefer existing dependencies and conventions.
- Keep changes scoped to this prompt.
- Do not silently change architecture or specifications.
- Keep secrets outside source control.
- Use strict typing.
- Add tests appropriate to the change.
- If a test fails, determine whether it is pre-existing or caused by your changes.
- Do not proceed to the next implementation prompt automatically.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implementation matches the relevant authoritative specifications.
- [ ] Changes are scoped to this prompt.
- [ ] Type safety is preserved.
- [ ] Relevant tests are added or updated.
- [ ] Existing relevant tests pass.
- [ ] No fabricated behavior or data was introduced.
- [ ] No secrets were committed.
- [ ] Documentation is updated where necessary.
- [ ] The completion report is produced.
- [ ] The agent stops after this prompt.
