# Prompt 14 — Investigation UI

## Objective

Implement the investigation creation and progress experience.

Core journey:
Begin an investigation → enter question → create investigation → show meaningful research progress → show resulting claims.

Requirements:
1. Use real backend state.
2. Handle CREATED, RESEARCHING, ANALYZING, READY, REVIEW_REQUIRED, and ERROR.
3. Never fake progress.
4. Show useful partial results when available.
5. Provide clear retry/error paths.
6. Maintain accessibility.
7. Keep motion subtle and purposeful.

Add component and integration tests.

## Read Before Starting

Read the authoritative EvidenceOS specifications before making changes:

- `CONTEXT.md`
- `PRD.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `DATA_MODEL.md`
- `AGENT_SPEC.md`
- `WORKFLOW.md`
- `EVALUATION.md`
- `UI_SPEC.md`
- `RULES.md`
- `BUILD_PLAN.md`
- `HARNESS.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`

Also inspect the current repository before changing anything.

## Global Constraints

- Do not assume the repository is empty.
- Preserve working behavior unless this prompt explicitly changes it.
- Do not fabricate data, sources, citations, API responses, or test results.
- Prefer existing dependencies and conventions.
- Keep changes scoped to this prompt.
- Do not silently change architecture or specifications.
- Keep secrets outside source control.
- Use strict typing.
- Add tests appropriate to the change.
- If a test fails, determine whether it is pre-existing or caused by your changes.
- Do not proceed to the next implementation prompt automatically.
