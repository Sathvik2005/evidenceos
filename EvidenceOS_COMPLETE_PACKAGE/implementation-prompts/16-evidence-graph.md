# Prompt 16 — Evidence Graph

## Objective

Implement a minimal Evidence Graph visualization.

Show:
Claim ↔ Evidence ↔ Source relationships.

Requirements:
1. Prioritize readability over visual complexity.
2. Allow inspection of nodes and relationships.
3. Preserve provenance.
4. Distinguish support and contradiction.
5. Do not add decorative graph effects.
6. Keep performance acceptable for the MVP dataset.
7. Add accessibility fallback/list representation.
8. Add tests for graph construction and representative rendering.

## Read Before Starting

Read the authoritative EvidenceOS specifications before making changes:

- `CONTEXT.md`
- `PRD.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `DATA_MODEL.md`
- `AGENT_SPEC.md`
- `WORKFLOW.md`
- `EVALUATION.md`
- `UI_SPEC.md`
- `RULES.md`
- `BUILD_PLAN.md`
- `HARNESS.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`

Also inspect the current repository before changing anything.

## Global Constraints

- Do not assume the repository is empty.
- Preserve working behavior unless this prompt explicitly changes it.
- Do not fabricate data, sources, citations, API responses, or test results.
- Prefer existing dependencies and conventions.
- Keep changes scoped to this prompt.
- Do not silently change architecture or specifications.
- Keep secrets outside source control.
- Use strict typing.
- Add tests appropriate to the change.
- If a test fails, determine whether it is pre-existing or caused by your changes.
- Do not proceed to the next implementation prompt automatically.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implementation matches the relevant authoritative specifications.
- [ ] Changes are scoped to this prompt.
- [ ] Type safety is preserved.
- [ ] Relevant tests are added or updated.
- [ ] Existing relevant tests pass.
- [ ] No fabricated behavior or data was introduced.
- [ ] No secrets were committed.
- [ ] Documentation is updated where necessary.
- [ ] The completion report is produced.
- [ ] The agent stops after this prompt.
